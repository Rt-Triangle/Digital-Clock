# Notice
**This project is no longer maintained and is now for learning purposes only**

It was abandoned because this design has many bugs that have not been fixed and many thorny issues have arisen.

The bugs are:
1. LDO related capacitive pads are not designed as tantalum capacitive pads.
2. Switch connected to the MCU has a wrong design.
3. USB is not routed according to the differential distribution method.
4. The power circuit is in a mess.
5. Clock chip prices are too high.
